                <h3>Map of India by Sanson</h3>
                <p>
                This is a map of India made in 1652 by cartographer Nicholas Sanson. It shows the southern part of India from the Bay of Bengal to Sri Lanka. It is written in French since it was made by a famous French cartographer. The map itself is 8 inches (20.3 cm) tall, and 10 inches (25.4 cm) wide. It is quite small relative to other maps and would be difficult to read the names and text.
                </p>
                <p>
                This portrayal is a lot different to the actual geography of India. Many of the kingdoms represented in the map had actually fallen for more than a century before the publication of this map. This shows how out of touch France’s knowledge of India was. The map offers a good guess as the interior of India was largely uncharted to the West. The map was used to acquire land that would become the cornerstone of French trade in the East. These lands were colonized by the French and were safe from the British. This is why they housed a lot of the freedom fighters even after the Partition of Bengal in 1905.

                <p>
                This source is quite reliable as it represents objective data. The French cartographer drew this for French navigators and would have put up the best data he could at the time.

                <h3>Statue of Girl with bird</h3>
                <p>
                In the late 1940s, Sir Mortimer Wheeler conducted a range of archaeological excavations in Pondicherry. This statue depicts a young girl with a bird. It was found at the site, along with Roman lamps, glassware, and gems. It was dated to be made in the 2nd Century CE. The digging site, Arikamedu was identified as a trading post with Rome that started during the rule of Augustus Caesar. It lasted for about 2 centuries. The statue also shows how technologically advanced the Indians were at the time. They knew how to make and work with clay.
                </p>
                <p>
                A large part of Indian culture includes art, animals, and. The prevalent religion in India, Hinduism has a large focus on animals, and nature. They play big roles in its mythology and beliefs. These factors are just as, if not more relevant today. A lot of countries have had some number of Indians migrating to them, bringing their culture with them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This shows how connected India was with the outside world even before French colonisation. They had sculptures like that of many cultures like the Egyptians, Greek and Native Americans. The source is reliable as it is a clay statue, and the artist would have sculpted with a reference in front of him as opposed to from his imagination

                <h3>French "dou-dou" coin</h3>
                <p>
                This is a small coin made of copper that was found in India. One side of the coin has a <i>“fleur de lis” </i> on one side. A <i>“fleur de lis” </i> is commonly used to symbolize the French monarchy, as well as the saints of France. On the other side was minted <i>“Puducherry” </i> in Tamil script. They were minted around 1720 – 1837. These coins were called “dou-dou”.          </p>
                <p>
                India’s main exports in the 18th and 19th centuries were silk, cotton, spices, sugar, and precious stones.  Most western countries (like France) began making coins around 700 BC. Ancient India was one of the first users of coins, as they were issued during the 6th century BC. Coins were already big parts of both societies. The significance of this coin, however, is much larger. This coin represents the union of both India and France. Although the French had control over India and colonized it, both parties were heavily impacted. They were clearly made to be used by Indians as well as French due to the Tamil text on one side. French is still one of the official languages of Pondicherry and about 85% of all French people registered in South India are in Pondicherry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This source is reliable as it is a coin and was mass-produced to some extent, for the whole population in Pondicherry. It is useful not only to gauge the technological level of the society, but to understand the interplay between France and India. This source cannot however show the FULL relationship between France and India.

                <h3>Painting of Pierre-Oliver Malherbe</h3>
                <p>
                This is a depiction of Pierre-Oliver Malherbe. He was one of the first ever French circumnavigators. It was dated as being painted in the late 1700s. Malherbe went on a 27-year tour and went to his home in France in 1609. When he came back, he told King Henry IV about the various precious metals in the East. This would later Malherbe’s costume is a mixture of French shirts and collars, but his pants are very similar to those worn by Indians at the time. The background is also warm and shows multiple Indian temples and houses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This shows the artistic impact of the Indian culture on the French.  This artwork combines the art style of the French Renaissance with vivid Indian colours and imagery. France has always been celebrated for its artists and art. India also has a rich culture with many visual artworks and other media. In the background there are also people praying in front of the temple. This shows how the French noticed and acknowledged the cultures and religion and may have been influenced by it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The image may not be very reliable as it could have been made from the painter’s imagination as opposed to being a portrait. The source is also not very useful to understand the impact and relationships between the societies. It is more of a visual aid rather than a very complex piece.

                <h3>Bharathi Park Monument</h3>
                <p>
                This is Bharati Park, a landmark in Pondicherry. The structure in the centre of the park is in a Greco-Roman style and was built in 1854.
                </p>
                <p>The park and its monument were made to honour Aayi Mandapam, an Indian courtesan living in Puducherry during the early 16th century. King Krishnadeva Raya was on a visit in the area at the time. He mistook Aayi’s house for a temple and started bowing and praying to it. When he found the truth about the situation he ordered for the demolition of the house, and a pond to be made on the land. This pond would later provide drinking water to whole of Pundcherry during French rule. Napoleon Bonaparte III, the ruler of France, was amazed at this story, and commanded that a monument be made to honour it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The pond was made 200 years before it was needed, but it still proved to be a crucial resource. This symbolizes the mutual respect both cultures had for each other. Not only would the French emperor want to listen to the story of such an important resource but also made a monument to respect it. The monument itself depicts Aayi and has a water fountain at the centre. The name itself is an homage to the poet Bharathisadan. This backs up the impact the Indian society had on the French. This source is reliable as it is still standing today. However, the story behind it is a legend and may not be true. The source also cannot show the full influence both cultures had on each other.
